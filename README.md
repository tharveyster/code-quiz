# Code Quiz Challenge

## Description
This project is a quiz of web development coding questions. It was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

When you press the **start** button, the screen changes to display a question with four answers, and a 75 second countdown clock starts running. As each question is answered, it moves to the next question and displays either **Correct!** or **Wrong!** for the prior answer for one second beneath the new answer list.

Each wrong answer results in ten seconds being removed from the remaining time.

When the last question is answered, it shifts to another view that shows your score and lets you enter your initials and displays them on the high scores list.

You can then go back to the start or clear the high scores.
